# RateMyProfessor_Project3
Utilized a python web scraper to access RateMyProfessor.com data for the top 50 universities and public schools in Florida to recommend the top professors in each university. Managed over 100,000 data sets in two distinct data structures (BST and Hash Table) and compared their run time.

Our project frontend is implemented with QtCreator IDE and uses Qt specific functions.
